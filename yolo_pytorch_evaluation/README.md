This directory contains the evaluation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection implementation using the PyTorch deep learning framework. YOLO is a popular and efficient real-time object detection algorithm that has been widely adopted in various fields, including science, engineering, and computer vision applications.

The PyTorch-based YOLO implementation takes advantage of the flexibility and efficiency of the PyTorch framework, making it easier to train, fine-tune, and deploy the model for various tasks. This particular YOLO variant can be used for tasks such as:

Autonomous vehicles
Robotics
Surveillance and security
Industrial automation
Image and video analysis
YOLO PyTorch is an application built using the PyTorch framework. It is neither a programming tool nor a middleware. It is an end-to-end object detection solution that can be easily integrated into other applications and pipelines.
